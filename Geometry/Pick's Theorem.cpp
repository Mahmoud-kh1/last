Given a certain lattice polygon with non-zero area.
We denote its area by S , the number of points with integer coordinates lying strictly inside the polygon by  I  and the number of points lying on polygon sides by B .
Then, the Pick's formula states:
    S = I + (B / 2) - 1 

and we can fine the number of lattice point in segment that represents with p1 and p2 as  gcd(abs(p1.x - p2.x) , abs(p1.y - p2.y)) + 1
